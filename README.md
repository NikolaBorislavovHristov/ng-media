##[ng-media]

###[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) support for HTML5 media elements

**coming soon**

ng-media provides a simple, declarative means for using HTML5 audio and video elements.

Things to expect in the near future:

- Video overlays
- Custom controls
- data-bound posters
- Evaluate expressions in response to media events

Things which would be very cool that I would like to provide:

- WebVTT / TTML tracks for Video elements
- DSP effects (one can dream!)

###Contributing

Pull requests, bug reports and suggestions are quite welcome.

Code submissions should follow the [Google JavaScript Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml), and each and every new feature or bug fix should incorporate one or more meaningful tests to assist in preventing future regressions.
